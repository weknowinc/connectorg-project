# The following three lines are required, our profile wonâ€™t work without them:
name: connectorg
type: profile
core: 8.x
core_version_requirement: ^8 || ^9

# Optionally we may also give a description for our profile or declare our
# installation profile as a distribution, so that it'll be auto-selected.
# If the profile was declared as a distribution, normally we will not be able
# to see the profile's description, so it makes sense to use only one of the
# following parameters.

# description: connectorg profile 1.0 for intranet projects
distribution:
  name: connectorg

# Note: if there are more then one distributions within the profiles/ folder,
# Drupal 8 will auto-select the one whose name goes first alphabethically.
